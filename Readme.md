# Painting Toy For Kyle

Very quick and ugly generative art that I build based on [Kyle](http://kyleclements.com/)'s description. He wanted it to project on a canvas to then paint. It includes a save and load feature because each layer of the painting is oil and takes a long time to dry.

I'm always up to trade code for art!
